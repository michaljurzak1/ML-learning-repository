# MNIST_classification
This repository follows the third chapter of a book [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/03_classification.ipynb) about Classification. As an example, MNIST dataset is used.  
The purpose of this project is purely educational.

In case of starting the notebook from beginning check a few last lines. The purpose of the notebook is educational and it shows many options stated in the book and few cells may take an unexpected amount of time thus it is highly advised to customise a few cells to your own purpose.
